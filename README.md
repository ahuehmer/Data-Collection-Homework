### **Mars Weather**
Mars Weather asked to scrape a table with Mars weather related data from a website and extract certain elements of it and perform data analysis. Finally, multiple graphs were created to determine for example the coldest and warmest months, the months with highest and lowest pressure, as well as an estimate on how many terrestrial days made up a martian year.
